I make it as easy as possible and make a lot of action for you to accelerate 
your inputing coding , accoding to the habit of a coder . So i make a lot of 
expand 'key' word to append the content with hot key <c-cr> , and move to the
different area just by <tab> . So ,try and  enjoy it ! I am sure you will love it!

I add the function that let the ( can  complete the function prototype when you input 
your coding  which make you not have to remeber the sequence of the function arguments.

Add the menu item which let you can  control whether this plugin can start or stop.
And of course you can let it start automatically by add this to your vimrc:
let g:TTrCodeAssistor_AutoStart=1

usage :
<c-cr> to expand the 'key' word ( you can change it to you habit )
<tab> to move forward and <s-tab> to move backward between the 'labels'
(         key to compete the function prototype automantically.
)         automatically move or input itself accoding to the content
<bs>   use as normal but will remove the ) when its front char is (

Recently ,  i will just add some useful function without map them to some key
Just to expand the function of this plugin , so you can map it according to  your taste. :-)
1. TTrcodeAssistor_ToggleComments
                  nnoremap <F7> :call TTrCodeAssistor_ToggleComments()<CR>
                  vnoremap <F7> :call TTrCodeAssistor_ToggleComments()<CR>


Note : 
       the function prototype completing must use the exuberant ctags to
       make the tag files which you should add to vim by :set ctags+=/your/file
       and You have to add the arguments  --fields=+S after all your arguments
       while making the tag files with 'ctags'
       ex : Make the tags for all the  files of current directory including the subdirectory
             ctags -R --c-types=+p --fields=+S *

'key' word table can be seen in the file.

Just have a try.
